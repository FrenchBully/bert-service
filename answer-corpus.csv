It made me reflect on how we treat individuals with SMI as criminals
"In my work I see many people come into the criminal justice system and some are lucky enough to be diverted to a treatment court. There are some individuals who are successful and don't have the added burden of a criminal record but what happens afterwards is not always a happy ending.
Society has to help these people to have a life after their crisis, a sense of purpose and a safe place to exist. A place where they can go when overwhelmed before they hurts themselves or others"
"This program gave me some more background and dimensions beside my own involvement with mental illness. On other issues as well, society views people who cannot help them self's as week, not trying hard enough and unworthy of assistance. Other priorities are more important. Feelings of anger and despair already existed. I have not found any way of action besides being more open about my mental help crisis with others."
"It felt like ""about us without us.""  It felt like a movie by a family member of a disabled person - for other family members of disabled people
As a person who is mentally ill, this movie missed the mark.  While it has some truthful information about the medical industrial complex and the prison industrial complex it lacks solution outside those.  I even tried watching the PBS q and a panel and had to shut it off because it's so othering of this mentally ill person.  All these ""experts"" and ""impacted families.""
Empower a mentally ill person to direct these movies
Put the kops in 5 point restraints.
You need leaders from the disability justice community doing the talking"
"I am a retired police officer from NY (80-90's) and dealt with mental illness daily. Homeless shelters and the street were where most resided and most always landed in jail if became combatant towards the public. The 60's- 80's saw horrific abuse and experimentation so the release and closures of hospitals was the catalyst. When one is released from a hospital, jail or prison there is NO PLACE for them to go, no supervised care and no net to keep them from spiraling down....WHY...because no one gives a damn! People do not want to know or see! only those whose lives are affected will see! My friend  was killed in the line of duty by a guy who was mentally ill! Politicians are not going to ask for money for mental illness over schools or community parks! Schools have employees who are told to push kids thru and not to rock the boat, not trained properly nor really care since not their pay scale or up against a bureaucracy.  They cant handle bullying never mind mental illness. Unless states are held civilly liable for releasing mentally ill people who in turn hurt or in many cases kill another this program will be used in classes ( I will be adding to my array of mentally ill documentaries for my criminal justice students in college) and in 5 years I will view another one just like it and the cycle will continue. I applaud the effort to educate the public and I attempt to do my part in passing it on to others."
"It has been very obvious to me, the Lack Of on going support. I have a child born in 1986; before Autism was recognized. The Names they wanted to place on him in his IEP were awful! I refused to let them call him that, much less put it in a file!
I am Still fearful of what/where he will be when I am gone-Many/Most sleepless nights...
There is So Much More that needs to be done/put into place for people with mental illnesses, physical, occupational. I Will continue my prayers ?? for All."
"This program brought up personal issues.
Although I have been hospitalized in short term venues as  result of suicide attempts, I have been able to move on and live a productive life.
I am extremely moved by this subject. As a country, we must care for the mentally challenged. If this had been me, I would have become as agitated, angry as those  who were highlighted. I am a combat vet with PTSD; I have lived with its misconceptions and the battle to get diagnosed. It is much easier to get treatment for a physical problem than it is for a mental one."

"Bedlam stirs the need for action and addresses the issue of stigma of mental illness. A successful treatment model is needed and it would be helpful to show what is needed. I thought the court system that was featured that treated the mentally ill man with humane treatment was good to see and showed that this should be used nation wide. I wish more information about NAMI was shared. Family to family, a program by NAMI could be shared to help caregivers. In summary, we have an enormous problem with treatment and a need for more drugs and research for mental illness."
"I knew only some of the details related in this film. I was horrified. I am 62 and masters level educated. I started out as a counselor trying to help juvenile offenders at a runaway shelter on the east coast in 1981. Even then, we received kids there who obviously had mental  issues of varying levels, but I was only 23 and bach. Degree, so I was not equipped, we were paid only 9k per year and worked swing shift 24 hrs. I sawgirls who were sexually abused by their fathers, drugged teens, simple runaways, and even young girls beought to us by the state police at truck stops, having ridden with various truckers foe days, trying to move to fla and start a new life at age 15. It was so tragic, and i was so empathetic I couldn't take it anymore. I quit, wvwn though in some ways it was enormously emotionally rewarding. I have felt guilt foe.years not continuing to help them, and i see that us
 and state govt deserted vulnerable people also. It is not right. Something has to change, and not everything is solved by pharmaceuticals. I later recbd my masters.in clinical research and saw how big pharma has taken over where good mental illness care left off. This also has to stop. Combination behavioral, residential and drug therapy is best answer. Fed, state govts have to prioritize now."
"During when I was doing my graduate work in counseling ,there was huge effective movement to close the many state hospitals , at least in the North East- Penn.  and North. In many discussion groups I remember being the relative ""lone wolf "" and asking what do we do with those that are not able to go back in the community ? The answer always was. --- "" it will be figured out "" ---- well it has never been figured out !  We need to resist ""blaming "" anyone (s) and work toward a SOLUTION !"
This program inspires me to continue working as a volunteer with the problem of mental illness. I am  a retired  Psychiatric Clinal Nurse Specialist &  believe that Educating the public is of extreme importance.
"For a well-thought out response I'm a person who would need more time to process what I've just watched.
What I am able to say right now is that this is an important film and I'm glad to have seen it.
It strengthens my resolve to advocate for the family members I love and the students that I teach who struggle valiantly with mental illness.
on a slightly different note why was this important program relegated to a 10 PM timeslot? I think it would have found an even wider audience had it been broadcast at 9.
Also more advertising would've been great. Partnerships perhaps with NAMI, schools,  NPR, art house theatres.
I am a moderately active consumer of media. If I did not follow PBS on Instagram I don't know that I would have heard about this film.
Mostly though thank you. Thank you thank you thank you. This piece speaks for the voiceless. Now we need The conversation to continue."
"I think there should be a program instituted in all elementary schools to help screen for nascent mental illness.  More PSA's to make Joe Public aware of how prevalent and genetic mental illness is, not a lack of moral fiber.  More staff trained so home visits could follow-up on discharged patients.  Training for family and patients on the long and short-term effects.  More long term housing options.  More love and compassion."
"My son suffered suicidal ideation and depression as an adolescent.  Thank God, a mental health program existed at that time.  A live-in group home bed finally was available.  It saved his life, and our family.  That program no longer exists.  He survived and is living a happy and productive member of society(an out-of-work server during Covid-19.)
 As a nurse, I feel we need more education of issues of mental illness and treatment."
"I am the mother of four children with Autism, two who have adhd also so I have dealt with the system as far as psychiatry is concerned. I must say if you do not advocate for your loved one and really rally for the right medications that work, you will find yourself being a number or a guinea pig. This program helped reinforce the very truths that I have also been seeing all along and have spoken out about from the very beginning and it burned a fire in me to keep up the good fight not just for my children, but my family members dealing with mental issues and society as a whole."
"The first part is sadness for mental illness to be ignored; because it IS a true illness an should be treated as such. This program shows how much is Still needed to move the needle of change forward. It IS a beginning, a way to move forward in helping & guiding the mentally ill. God bless the doctors & nurses that participated. God bless the mentally ill who are still on the street or in jail."
"All I can tell you is that it makes me sad, angry, and reinforces my belief that greed has ruined our country!!!! You?"
"Such a thorough, well done examination of our current dismal state of treatment for those in our community who are the most in need, namely the seriously mentally ill. Please work to widely disseminate this - should be required       Viewing in all schools. I will show this to my staff - and we are a group of psychologists that work in jails."
"I cried. My beloved son died because of his mental health issues. I did everything I could to save him. He was very intelligent. He was very kind. He had a wicked sense of humor. My biggest fear was that I would leave him on his own. He died because he self medicated with legal drugs, illegsl drugs, and alcohol. He drug me to my knees and left me financially devastated. I would have gladly given my life to save him and make him whole. Mental health issues fo not stop at five o'clock. Thank you."
"I did not have an understanding of the architecture of the crisis prior to this program. Although I am a compassionate person, it made me even more sympathetic. I do feel these people have been abandoned and it is societies responsibility to take care of our human family. The lack of appropriate for this group is societies mental illness.
Thank you for making this film."
This program put into focus what I already have experienced as the mother of a severely mentally ill adult daughter who was college educated. The system is broken and my daughter is lucky to be alive.
"Since my oldest was two I have navigated the mental health access field. Since my oldest symptoms were situational I was told that hey don't worry they will grow out of it. I have had family members say that. Here we are five years later. The school sy stem has been a great asset. Whereas, the primary doctor was unwilling to help, the school has been. My child has been in therapy now covered by a grant. I hate that it takes this long to get help when you KNOW something is not quite right."
"I'm grateful for programs like this, yet there are not enough. The stigma regarding mental illness is so great. There need to be more mental health beds. There needs to be different ways to treat those with severe mental illness in environments that are safe and nourishing, not punishing and threatening. We need more long term care facilities that are well funded, well staffed, and well educated.
My heart went out to so many in this program. I shed tears more than once. As a mom, it was so good to see Delilah smiling at the end. Treatment is so important and needs to be embraced. So glad that the complexity of being Black with mental illness was addressed. Thank you for this film."
"Being an occupational nurse, I've seen results of ever-decreasing mental health services (even with those with insurance). I wish I had answers to this crisis.  Something has to be done.  This problem is huge.  Thank you for bringing much-needed attention to it."
"Watching the movie as someone with bipolar, I see as a professional with great benefits when I first ended up in the hospital. I continue to get all the"
"My 24 yr old son lives with psychosis and is currently unmedicated, living in his vehicle 2,800 miles from me.  My only link being a singular credit card that I monitor almost every hour. I have sought help for him since his suffering started over one year ago.  This documentary speaks to me through the resilience and remorse of caretakers.  My NAMI facilitators and family have been of tremendous support.  Each homeless person represents a family torn apart and most importantly a beautiful life in need of care.
I seek to help abolish the isolation of families who suffer with no help.  I find hope in all of this. Indeed there is hope. I'm grateful for this documentary which I was afraid to watch.
Thank you."
"It strengthens my resolve to advocate for dignity, trauma-informed care, Justice And evidence based solutions for those who suffer with mental health challenges."
"The documentary and tonight's webinar gave me the insight, at 66 years old, that my depression through the decades has come from the shame and stigma of growing up in a family of mental illness. I have hope that today's children won't have to struggle their whole lives to be free."
I feel that to address the crisis holistically we need a system that cares for the seriosuly mental ill as in the film as well as addiction and other mental health diagnoses.  Often everyone is clumped together which is better than no help.  Supportive residential and crisis centers that provide education along with a variety of other supports are essential.
"I am getting ready to watch the film again.
I have lived with & loved a family with mental health/substance abuse issues thru my entire generation.
I believe the public needs to bombard the political system with our mental health concerns. Myla folks have faced little more than stigma when they've sought help from main stream medical access. Most ER visits for mental breakdowns I've experienced (with multiple people) do not end well."
I have a son with schizophrenia and i just thank god that he has me and Nami of NC to advocate for him when he is having an episode.
I am a middle school counselor. Over 15 years in the classroom I am seeing an increase in mental illness in youth. The school system is criminalizing behavior that is related to mental illness. These students are seen as expendable. Bedlam reinvigorated me to continue having the mental health conversations in my school district and increasing my knowledge and activism in my community.
"(1/3) Watching the film, I saw every person experiencing chronic homelessness that I interact with daily. Helplessness is an emotion I often feel due to the lac"
"As a clinician with experience working in psychiatric hospitals (public and private) and providing community mental health services, Bedlam solidifies the need for access to adequate community-based services that assists individuals with physical and mental health care, independent living skills, financial security, food security, housing, social connections, etc."
"I'm a clinical social worker who worked with people with schizophrenia and related disorders for twenty years. There are so many community-based treatments and support that work, and simply aren't available. And we also need housing and income supports. What the film shows is the complexity of poverty combined with serious mental illness. I know many recovery stories. Relationship, community, practical assistance combined with good psychiatric treatment. We need to find the will to provide what works."
"I am so grateful for this documentary and feel it spotlights so many of the struggles faced by people living with mental illness and their families. My family deals every day with worries about possible relapses, cost of medication, affordable safe housing, and what will happen when I'm no longer here to help my son. Families need to be and want to be involved but we need help just like you would expect with physical illnesses.
Thank you for all you are doing!"
"I cried through much of the film, having mental illness in the family. Dr. Rosenberg's comment during tonight's webinar that ""the burden falls squarely on the family"" was our family's experience."
"Excellent educational film. There needs to be much more education of public on mental illness from serious mental health but also to de-stigmatize and educate for less serious, but just as painful and debilitating mental health issues of depression/anxiety."
I am a psych nurse and nurse educator of many years. PhD prepared so my research involves preparing nurses to manage the care of patients who have mi in non-psychiatric settings.  Such as Med- Surg.  Both practicing and ore- licensure students.  This film for many is a great tool to contribute to understanding of mental illness and for nurses to consider early assessment and intervention that can be transformative for many patients with the co- morbidities of physical and mi   Community health nurses    Nurses in primary care.  Etc.
The program opened my eyes to the significant closure of mental health treatment facilities over the past century.  The lack of govt support for those struggling with mental health has left a vacuum and forced ERs to step in and caused many to end up in prison but there has also been a dearth of funding for research on new therapies (pharmaceutical and otherwise). Prison is not the place for people that are struggling with a disease at NO fault of their own.  We must teach community to embrace and destigmatize people who struggle with mental illness and show them Love.
"I am a mother of a daughter with severe mental illness and am raising her 17 year-old son who is also mentally ill.  I sometimes feel there is not enough knowledge to help us, even from doctors (I have had mostly good experiences with doctors btw).  I am active in NAMI but often feel we are not having the impact we could since we often don't have real answers to people's issues.  But I loved the film and think it is so important to educate everyone and help others to understand more. I will always try to help."
The program reinforced my passion for mental health. I know strongly that intervening as early as possible is key. The program was incredibly moving and I am inspired to make changes in my community.
Our family has dealt with our adult son's schizoaffective disorder for over 10 years. Without family involvement I don't think  our son would be alive today. The burden of care is great. The movie is a window opened for the general public to get a glimpse of insight into this series problem of the poor state of care for mental illness in this country. I shed tears in solidarity with the patients and their lived ones.
As a provider of behavioral health the program and panel makes me aware of how the stigma is still here. If people understood how important case management is in care
"I agree with the issues, not the solutions that hospital beds and medications are the answer"
"This program opened my eyes to just how prevalent mental illness is throughout America, and how difficult it may be to house and help those with mental illness. It has made me more interested in helping those with mental illnesses and helping everyone feel safe and comfortable with sharing their experiences"
I learned a lot about the history and current state. I am hopeful that there will be a Part 2 that focuses on real solutions
This program put into focus what I already have experienced as the mother of a severely mentally ill adult daughter who was college educated.  The system is broken and my daughter is lucky to be alive.
